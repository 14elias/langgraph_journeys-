Subject: Class Absence Tomorrow

Dear Daniel,

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to inform you that I will not be able to attend class tomorrow as I have an interview scheduled at the same time.

I appreciate your understanding and support. I will make sure to catch up on any missed material.

Thank you very much.

Best regards,

[Your Name]
